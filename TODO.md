# StarTraining Pipeline - Future Tasks

## Cerrar Workflow (Current Phase)
- [ ] Miguel: Provide email address to include in Google Drive sharing
- [ ] Miguel: Gain direct access to RAW files folder (upload permissions)
- [ ] Workflow: Receive email notification from workflow (implemented in v1.3.7)

## Next Phase: WhatsApp Integration
- [ ] Connect workflow to WhatsApp Business API
- [ ] Configure WhatsApp credentials in n8n
- [ ] Add WhatsApp node to send workout images directly to group/users

## Next Phase: AimHarder Integration
- [ ] Generate text content for AimHarder platform
- [ ] Define text format/template requirements
- [ ] Add text generation step to pipeline (Agent D or new agent)

## Future Development: SaaS/Commercial Viability

### Input Document Alternatives
**Strategic Goal:** Evaluate alternatives to the current Word document input (RAW folder) to facilitate converting the StarTraining workflow into a SaaS product or sellable service via app.

**Candidate Solutions:**
- [ ] **Word Template** - Structured .docx template with predefined fields
  - Evaluation: Ease of use, API accessibility, data validation, scalability, cost, integration complexity
- [ ] **Notion Database** - Web-based, collaborative, API-accessible
  - Evaluation: Ease of use, API accessibility, data validation, scalability, cost, integration complexity
- [ ] **Excel/Google Sheets** - Spreadsheet format, easy data validation, API available
  - Evaluation: Ease of use, API accessibility, data validation, scalability, cost, integration complexity
- [ ] **Custom Web Form** - Direct input via web interface
  - Evaluation: Ease of use, API accessibility, data validation, scalability, cost, integration complexity
- [ ] **Mobile App Input** - Native app for coaches to input workout data
  - Evaluation: Ease of use, API accessibility, data validation, scalability, cost, integration complexity
- [ ] **Airtable** - Database with forms, API, and automations
  - Evaluation: Ease of use, API accessibility, data validation, scalability, cost, integration complexity
- [ ] **Typeform/Google Forms** - Simple form-based input with integrations
  - Evaluation: Ease of use, API accessibility, data validation, scalability, cost, integration complexity

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Ease of use for end users (coaches)
2. API accessibility for automation
3. Data validation capabilities
4. Multi-user/multi-gym scalability
5. Cost structure for SaaS model
6. Integration complexity with current pipeline

**Strategic Context:** This analysis is critical for transforming the workflow from a personal automation tool into a commercial product that can serve multiple gyms/coaches simultaneously.
